# Hotel Reservations Classification

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict hotel booking cancellations based on a dataset of hotel reservations. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled or not. To achieve this, we employ various data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and balancing the dataset to mitigate class imbalance.  We then apply a decision tree classifier to classify reservations and use K-Fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.
